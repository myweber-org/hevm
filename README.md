# hevm

`hevm` is an implementation of the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) made for
symbolic execution, equivalence checking, and unit testing of smart contracts.
`hevm` can symbolically execute smart contracts, run unit tests, and run
arbitrary EVM code. It can run on state set up in a [`ds-test` testing
harness](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/forge-std), or fetched on demand from
live network using `rpc` calls.

`hevm` was originally developed as part of the
[dapptools](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/) project, and was forked to
this repo by the formal methods team at the Ethereum Foundation in August 2022.

## Documentation & Support

User facing documentation can be found in the [hevm book](https://hevm.dev/).

We have a public matrix chat room [here](https://matrix.to/#/%23hevm%3Amatrix.org).

## Installation

### Static Binaries

Static binaries for x86 linux and macos are available for each
[release](https://github.com/ethereum/hevm/releases). These binaries expect to be able to find the
following programs on `PATH`:

- `solc`
- `z3`
- (optionally) `cvc5`
- (optionally) `bitwuzla`

### nixpkgs

hevm is available in
[`nixpkgs`](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=unstable&show=haskellPackages.hevm&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=hevm), and can be installed via:

- flakes: `nix profile install nixpkgs#haskellPackages.hevm`
- legacy: `nix-env -iA haskellPackages.hevm`

### nix flakes

hevm can be installed directly from the `main` branch of this repo via the following command:

```
nix profile install github:ethereum/hevm
```

## Development

We use `nix` to manage project dependencies. To start hacking on hevm you should first [install
nix](https://nixos.org/download.html).

Once nix is installed you can run `nix-shell` (or `nix develop` if you use flakes) from the repo
root to enter a development shell containing all required dev dependencies. If you use
[direnv](https://direnv.net/), then you can run `direnv allow`, and the shell will be automatically
entered each time you cd in the project repo.

Once in the shell you can use the usual `cabal` commands to build and test hevm:

```
$ cabal build          # build the hevm library
$ cabal build exe:hevm # build the cli binary
$ cabal build test     # build the test binary
$ cabal build bench    # build the benchmarks

$ cabal repl lib:hevm  # enter a repl for the library
$ cabal repl exe:hevm  # enter a repl for the cli
$ cabal repl test      # enter a repl for the tests
$ cabal repl bench     # enter a repl for the benchmarks

$ cabal run hevm       # run the cli binary
$ cabal run test       # run the test binary
$ cabal run bench      # run the benchmarks

# run the cli binary with profiling enabled
$ cabal run --enable-profiling hevm -- <CLI SUBCOMMAND> +RTS -s -p -RTS

# run the test binary with profiling enabled
$ cabal run --enable-profiling test -- +RTS -s -p -RTS

# run the benchmarks with profiling enabled
$ cabal run --enable-profiling bench -- +RTS -s -p -RTS
```

A high level overview of the architecture can be found in [architecture.md](./architecture.md).
